lein test schist.config-test

Needed to put exception class made with :gen-class into the "aot" section of project.clj for it to get compiled and
accessible to import.

Using the "run with intellij classpath" test runner configuration works when "test" profile is added through the cursive leiningen window (righthand side).
    However, I added this unconditionally, leading to "test" libs being require-able at main time. This is not the case with regular lein command line runs,
    where profiles are better understood. I can live with this state of affairs for now.


(require '[clojure.spec.alpha :as s])


(s/def :x/r string?)
    good
(s/def ::r string?)
    good
(s/def :r string?)
    bad - what is the difference from two above?
    I think the reason is to be used with spec keywords have to be fully-qualified. a regular keyword like ":k" isn't. "::k" means 'in the current namespace'
    or ":other-namespace/k" means in that namespace.



(map (fn [x] (async/thread (println (:id (bean (Thread/currentThread)))))) (range 10))

    really does run stuff in different threads, by default in the same one each time when enough pause in the REPL to make things finish.
    meaning it's using a pretty good thread pool internally.


I do think specter is the way to go, no native idea of "mapping over maps". borkdude approved.
